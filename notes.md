# Notes & Planning

## Game Premise
You are Cora, a tiny, excitable kitten who LOVES TO PLAY WITH EVERYTHING. Everything in Cora's world is a food, a friend, or a toy, and the best thing to do with your toys is DESTROY THEM. You find yourself in a room full of SO. MANY. TOYS. and you can't wait to destroy them all!

## Gameplay
Move Cora with WASD and walk up to things in the room to interact with them. Your goal is to break everything in the room, but the challenge is to find the best way to do it. Objects are affected by each other and with the environment, plus you don't want your human to catch you before you get a chance to break it all! Try to find the best order to help Cora Destroy Everything!
