# Cora Breaks Everything!
You are Cora, a tiny, excitable kitten who LOVES TO PLAY WITH EVERYTHING. Everything in Cora's world is a food, a friend, or a toy, and the best thing to do with your toys is DESTROY THEM. You find yourself in a room full of SO. MANY. TOYS. and you can't wait to destroy them all!

## Installation Instructions
- index.html, style.css, app.js, and the .png files in the images folder are all that is needed to download
- a browser capable of running HTML5 Canvas is required

## Gameplay
Move Cora with your mouse and walk up to things in the room to interact with them. Your goal is to break everything in the room, but the challenge is to find the best way to do it. Objects are affected by each other and with the environment, plus you don't want your human to catch you before you get a chance to break it all! Try to find the best order to help Cora Destroy Everything!

## Technologies Used
This game was made entirely with HTML5 Canvas. All artwork was created by me on Adobe Illustrator.

## Approach Taken
I wrote the original code with WASD movement in mind, but later switched to point & click with the mouse. The game flowed better with this method. I love point & click games and was excited to create one of my own. I started with rendering rectangles of all the furniture objects and Cora and built functions to "break" them. Then I went through and wrote the relationships between the objects and how they can level up or down based on the user's choices. I built the basic win conditions and added scoring last.

## Biggest Challenges
- getting the overlay messages to not overwrite each other too fast
- replacing the object rectangles with images

## Unsolved Issues
- I would like to find a way to disable the canvas from being clicked when the overlay is visible
- The score div disappears a little sooner than I would like
- See "notes" for Wish List and future improvement plans
